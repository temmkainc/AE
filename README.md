# AE - Environmental Puzzle (Unity)

This project is a collection of environmental puzzles created in Unity.  
The player must solve a series of interactive challenges to obtain magical swords and unlock a hidden passage.

The [DOTween](http://dotween.demigiant.com/) asset is used for smooth animations and transitions.
Voicelines of skulls were recorded and pitched by myself.

## Gameplay Overview
The player is trapped in a mysterious room containing several puzzles:

###  Melody Puzzle (Main Puzzle)
The player strikes enchanted swords that play musical notes.  
The goal is to reproduce a melody previously played by a gramophone.  
Upon success, the puzzle is solved.

###  Candle Puzzle
The player must light or extinguish candles in the correct pattern to open a chest and obtain a sword.

###  Skull Puzzle
Rotatable skulls give verbal clues to each other, hinting which direction they should face.  
Once all skulls are correctly oriented, a hidden wall with sword is revealed.

More puzzles, interactions, and environmental storytelling can be added for a deeper and more immersive experience.
