# AE - Environmental Puzzle (Unity)

This project is a collection of environmental puzzles created in Unity as part of a recruitment test task for a game development internship.

# Task Requirements
Create and implement an environmental puzzle (it doesn't have to be complicated) for a horror game in the "one room horror" genre (you can check out Amanda:The Adventurer as a reference that we worked on once). The puzzle should focus on 3 main elements:
* Swords
* Candlesticks
* Skulls

The project includes a single room target scene. The player should be able to move around the scene and interact with the appropriate objects. Pay special attention to the clarity and lucidity of the puzzle and the quality of the code - its readability and susceptibility to modifications in case of the need to expand the puzzle.
Additional advantages will be:
* taking care of visual and sound aspects - after all, it is supposed to be a horror (shaders, vfx, lights, sfx)
* using packages available in the project (UniTask, DOTween) or adding your own

The player must solve a series of interactive challenges to obtain magical swords and unlock a hidden passage.

The [DOTween](http://dotween.demigiant.com/) asset is used for smooth animations and transitions.
Voicelines of skulls were recorded and pitched by myself.

## Gameplay Overview
The player is trapped in a mysterious room containing several puzzles:

###  Melody Puzzle (Main Puzzle)
The player strikes enchanted swords that play musical notes.  
The goal is to reproduce a melody previously played by a gramophone.  
Upon success, the puzzle is solved.

###  Candle Puzzle
The player must light or extinguish candles in the correct pattern to open a chest and obtain a sword.

###  Skull Puzzle
Rotatable skulls give verbal clues to each other, hinting which direction they should face.  
Once all skulls are correctly oriented, a hidden wall with sword is revealed.

More puzzles, interactions, and environmental storytelling can be added for a deeper and more immersive experience.
